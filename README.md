# To Do

## client
- test w/ react testing library
- submit button
- render solution passed back from server
- sub grid lines for each 3x3 grid
- navigation buttons & navigation by arrow keys

client side state management requirements:
- v1, for each cell, a value and a type whethor or not it is part of the puzzle.


- v2, an array of puzzle solutions

workflow:
user types in multiple cells, then hits submit
sees either a solution appear filling in blank tiles with green numbers
or a message appears telling the user there is no solution
